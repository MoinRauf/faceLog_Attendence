# Facelog Attendance System

Welcome to Facelog Attendance System! This application utilizes facial recognition technology to facilitate employee attendance registration. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend is powered by Python Flask.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `facelog` directory.

   ```bash
   cd facelog
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

### Backend (Python Flask)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # For Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Flask and other dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -U flask-cors
   ```

4. In the `modelTester.py` file, update the following paths according to your system:

   ```bash
   HAARCASCADE_FILE_PATH = "YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/faceLog_Attendence/backend/static/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"
   TRAINING_DATA_PATH = "YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/faceLog_Attendence/backend/static/face-trainner"
   MODEL_PATH = "YOUR_LOCAL_PATH/faceLog_Attendence/backend/static/Trainner.yml"
   ```

5. Start the Flask server.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. The Flask server should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
